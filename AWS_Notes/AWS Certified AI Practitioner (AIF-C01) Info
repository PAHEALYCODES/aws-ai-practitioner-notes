Cost: $100 USD

Time: 90 Minutes

Format: 65 Questions (Multiple Choice & Multiple Response)

Passing Score: 700 / 1000

Scoring: 50 questions count towards your score; 15 are unscored "pre-test" questions (you won't know which is which, so answer all seriously).

Domain Breakdown

Domain 1: Fundamentals of AI and ML (20%)
Core Concepts: Know the difference between AI (broad field), ML (subset learning from data), and Deep Learning (neural networks).

Learning Types:

Supervised: Labeled data (e.g., spam vs. not spam).

Unsupervised: Unlabeled data, finding patterns (e.g., customer segmentation/clustering).

Reinforcement: Learning through trial and error (rewards/punishments).

Inference:

Real-time: Immediate response (low latency).

Batch: Processing large datasets at once (delayed).

Domain 2: Fundamentals of Generative AI (24%)
How it Works: Understand tokens (parts of words), embeddings (numerical vectors representing meaning), and transformers (the architecture behind GPT-like models).

Model Types:

LLMs: Text generation.

Diffusion Models: Image generation.

Multimodal: Models that handle text, image, and audio together.

Capabilities: Summarization, translation, code generation, and question answering.

Domain 3: Applications of Foundation Models (28%)
(This is the largest section)

Selection: Choosing the right model based on cost, speed, and modality.

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): Connecting models to your company data (Knowledge Bases) to fix hallucinations.

Fine-Tuning: specialized training on your own data.

Agents: AI that can perform actions (like booking a ticket) via API calls.

Domain 4: Guidelines for Responsible AI (14%)
Key Principles:

Fairness: preventing bias against specific groups.

Explainability: understanding how a model reached a conclusion.

Privacy: protecting user data.

Robustness: ensuring the model works under stress or attack.

Transparency: disclosing when AI is being used.

Bias Detection: Using tools like Amazon SageMaker Clarify.

Domain 5: Security, Compliance, and Governance (14%)
AI Security: Protecting against Prompt Injection (hacking the prompt) and model theft.

Compliance: Adhering to standards (GDPR, HIPAA) when using AI.

Governance: Managing who has access to use models (using AWS IAM) and tracking audit logs (using AWS CloudTrail).

Human-in-the-loop: Knowing when a human review is legally or ethically required.
