## 1. Introduction: AI, ML, DL, and Generative AI

### What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
AI refers to machines that can **learn, reason, plan, and understand** like humans.  
**Examples:** chatbots, email spam detection, voice assistants, recommendation systems, facial recognition, self-driving cars.

### What is Machine Learning (ML)?
ML is a **subset of AI** that learns patterns from data instead of using explicit rules.  
**Example:** Netflix recommending shows based on your watch history, loan approval prediction.

### What is Deep Learning (DL)?
DL is a **subset of ML** that uses **neural networks** (layers of nodes) to solve complex problems.  
**Examples:** image recognition, self-driving cars detecting pedestrians, speech recognition.

### What is Generative AI?
Generative AI refers to models that **create new content**, such as text, images, audio, or code.  
**Examples:** ChatGPT generating text, GitHub Copilot writing code, DALL·E creating images.

## 4. Beginner Notes / Step-by-Step

1. **Understand each AWS service**: What it does, input/output, and real examples.
2. **Focus on SageMaker first**: It's the core ML service.
3. **Practice with mini-projects**: Try a dataset to predict something simple (e.g., house prices).
4. **Relate to real-world AI concepts**: Reinforce learning by examples you see daily.

## 6. Key Takeaways

- AI is the broadest concept; ML, DL, and Generative AI are subsets.  
- SageMaker is your main tool for building ML models on AWS.  
- Lex = chatbots, Polly = text-to-speech, Transcribe = speech-to-text.  
- Practice mini-projects to understand the flow: input → process → output.
