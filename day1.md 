## What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
AI refers to machines that can learn, reason, plan, and understand like humans.  
Examples: chatbots, email spam detection, voice assistants, recommendation systems, facial recognition, self-driving cars.

## What is Machine Learning (ML)?
ML is a subset of AI that **learns patterns from data** instead of using explicit rules.  
Example: loan approval model, email spam filter.

## What is Deep Learning (DL)?
DL is a subset of ML that uses **neural networks** (layers of nodes) to solve complex problems.  
Examples: image recognition, self-driving cars, speech recognition.

## What is Generative AI?
Generative AI refers to models that **create new content**, such as text, images, audio, or code.  
Examples: ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot.

1. Amazon SageMaker

What it does: Lets you build, train, and deploy machine learning models on AWS
Input: Training data (CSV, images, text, etc.) + code
Output: A trained ML model (endpoint for predictions)
Real example: Predicting house prices, loan approval systems, product recommendations

2. Amazon Rekognition

What it does: Analyzes images and videos using AI
Input: Images or videos
Output: Labels, faces, objects, emotions, text detection
Real example: Face unlock systems, detecting people in CCTV footage, photo tagging

3. Amazon Lex

What it does: Builds chatbots and voice assistants
Input: Text or voice from users
Output: Bot responses (text or voice)
Real example: Customer support chatbots, booking bots, virtual assistants
